<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>hen TalkWorld loads up you will be presented
with a 'quick login screen.' If this is the first time you have used TalkWorld
then you should click on the 'change' button to be taken to the character
editor screen (see below). If your user name is already in the quick login
window because you have used TalkWorld before then click on the 'continue'
button to enter TalkWorld.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>C</FONT>lick on the 'character editor' icon and
you will be presented with the 'character editor' screen. Here registered
users can customize their character's name and appearance. If you have
not registered then simply click the 'OK' button to be logged in as a guest.
You will not be able to enter a name or change your appearance. Click <A HREF="registration.htm">here</A>
to find out how to register. </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>f you are a registered user enter the
name and password that you selected in the appropriate boxes. Note that
you TalkWorld name and password are case sensitive. Now you can select
the sex of your character and cycle through the outfits until you are satisfied.
If you put a check mark in the 'remember name and password' box then TalkWorld
will save your name, password, appearance and location when you log off
and use these settings next time you log back on. Using this option is
not recomended if other people have accsess to your P.C. Remember, the
name and appearance you choose will tell other users a lot about you, so
if you want to have a serious political discussion it's no good calling
yourself &quot;mr. axe head!&quot;</P></CENTER>
