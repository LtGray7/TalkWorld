TalkWorlds program options screen.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>C</FONT>onsole options allow you to change the
colour of the text window. The example text will show you what your choices
will look like. The scroll to new text option will cause TalkWorld to move
the text area down to any new messages that come in if you have scrolled
up to reread some text that you received earlier.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>S</FONT>peed options will alter how fast TalkWorld
runs on your P.C. If you have a less powerful machine then you can these
to keep TalkWorld smooth at the expense of it's appearance. If you turn
the draw distance down you will not be able to see as far into the distance
but becuase of this TalkWorld will run much faster. Turning off semi-transparency
will stop you being able to see through windows and again will speed TalkWorld
up.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>S</FONT>peech data is simply to choose whether
speech (not text) that you send or receive is sent directly between your
P.C. and the person you are sending to / receiving froms P.C. or sent to
/ from that person via the TalkWorld server. Normally you should leave
these switched off but if you are having difficulty talking ot listening
to a particular user try switching them on.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>These options will take affect immediatly and will be saved
when you log off.</P></CENTER>
