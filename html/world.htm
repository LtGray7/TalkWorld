<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he world. TalkWorld is a small town or
village which is divided up into several 'areas' such as the Church area
or the Tavern area. When you start you may or may not be able to see other
users in front of you. Don't worry if you can't see anyone else, TalkWorld
can take a while to explore thoroughly on foot so we've included the 'who?'
buttons to save you time. <BR>
There are three 'who?' buttons on the bar above the main view screen, 'world
who?' 'area who?' and 'whisper list.' The world and area who buttons simply
list all of the users in the whole of TalkWorld or only users in your immediate
area respectively. <BR>
The whisper list is a listing of all the users you have selected to hear
you when you whisper something (see below.)</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>o start with click on the 'world who?'
button and a window with the name of all the users that are currently online
will appear.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>E</FONT>xploring TalkWorld. Now you know who else
is in the world with you it's time to meet them. To move around in TalkWorld
you can either use the mouse or the cursor keys. If you are going to use
keys then the four cursor keys correspond to the direction you will move.
You can tell your character to run so that you move more quickly by holding
down the shift key. If you wish to use the mouse to move then as long as
the mouse pointer is over the main view screen you will see an arrow pointing
in a direction. Holding down the left button will make you move in that
direction until you let go. The further from the centre of the view screen
the pointer is when you hold down the button the faster you will move.
Experiment moving yourself around, if you want to enter a door simply walk
up to it and go through.</P></CENTER>
