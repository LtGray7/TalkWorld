<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>alkWorld is a 'virtual chat environment,'
it is a program that allows you to use the Internet to talk to other users
of TalkWorld from anywhere on Earth. When you join TalkWorld you will be
represented in a visual form by a computer sprite, sometimes called your
'character' or 'avatar'. Providing you have registered the appearance of
your character can be set by you. TalkWorld includes a large range of different
Male and Female sections that you can put together to create your own personalized
design. Non registered users all have identical appearances. </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>O</FONT>ne of the advantages of chat programs
is that they are extremely cheap to use. For instance an hour spent talking
to someone internationally by telephone would cost you a large amount of
money even at the cheapest rate. However because using the Internet is
always at local phone rates the same international conversation will cost
next to nothing. Most chat programs will allow you to type messages to
other users but this can be slow so TalkWorld allows you to actually speak
to other users using your microphone and speakers, just as if you were
speaking on the telephone. </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>alkworld is designed to represent a small
town. Because it is a graphical environment it is easier to use than text
only chat programs and can be interesting to explore even when there are
only a few users on-line. You can see other users moving around, you can
walk into the buildings, in short your character can do most of the things
you can do in reality. </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT>nother advantage TalkWorld has over older
chat programs is that it allows you to send e-mails to other registered
users which they can pick up next time they are on-line, or leave messages
on notice boards that are accessible to everyone. </P></CENTER>
