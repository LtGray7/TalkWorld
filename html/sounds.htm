<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>o physically speak to the other players
you will need to have a microphone and speakers plugged into your sound
card. </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT>t a basic level speaking to another user
is easy, simply click and hold down the button on the microphone icon in
the top right of the TalkWorld window and speak. Whilst you are holding
down the microphone icon TalkWorld will record from your microphone and
when you release the microphone icon it will send whatever it recorded
to the other users. The number of users who will hear your speech is set
in the same way as text, by using the 'shout to world', 'Talk to area'
or 'Whisper to' icons. </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>f you have problems with the speech or
sound effects then you may need to alter TalkWorlds sound options. To accsess
these click on the 'options' menu and choose ‘sound options’. You should
see the window below. From here you can edit how your copy of TalkWorld
will use your microphone and also set up your volume levels. </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>N</FONT>ote that in the 'sound options' screen
anything you say out loud will be played back only to you and not to other
users so you can check your whether your sound setup is working properly
by speaking on this screen. </P></CENTER>

The sound options screen.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>P</FONT>robably the most important option on this
screen is the 'Automatic recording' check box. If you put a tick mark in
here then once you exit the sound options screen you will not have to click
on the microphone icon if you want to talk, instead TalkWorld will automatically
detect when you are speaking and start and stop recording as it needs to.
If you decide to use this option then the recording threshold is used to
set the point at which your microphone activates. If you are in a noisy
environment or are using an extremely sensitive microphone then you will
need to turn the recording threshold up in order to stop the microphone
broadcasting background noise to the other users. You can also alter the
sensitivity bar if your microphone is picking up sounds like your breathing.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he 'Sound effects' and 'Speech volume'
bars are simply for you to alter volume levels to suit your taste and the
'Enable sound' check box will stop all sound from TalkWorld if you remove
the check from it.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he 'Speech playback' bar is for you to
set how many seconds of incoming speech your computer will store in it’s
memory ‘buffer’ before it passes it onto your sound card. For the smoothest
speech you should keep this set as low as possible, this will let you speak
to someone at the same speed as holding a conversation on a telephone.
On slower computers or if there is a lot of Internet traffic then you may
need to turn this setting up. This will cause TalkWorld to store up a few
seconds of incoming speech before releasing it to your sound card. This
may cause a slight delay in the speed of the speech arriving but it will
sound clear and unbroken when it does. You will only really need to alter
this setting if the speech sounds muffled or ‘choppy,’ try adjusting the
slider upwards until you hit an acceptable level.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he 'Full duplex sound card' box is there
to show whether your sound card is 100% full duplex. Many cards claim to
be full duplex but are not. Note that this is not an option and you cannot
change it, TalkWorld will automatically detect it when it starts up.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>N</FONT>ow you can talk to the users exactly as
you would type a message to them, simply select who you wish to speak to
and talk into your microphone. If they are unregistered or do not have
a microphone of their own then they will be able to hear you speaking but
will not be able to reply by speech, they will have to use the keyboard
as normal to reply. You should NOT be able to hear your own speech played
back to you as you talk. If it is being played back see the update below.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>U</FONT>pdate - It has come to our attention that
some users have found setting up the microphone for speaking in TalkWorld
to be difficult. Once it has been done TalkWorld remembers your setup but
getting it working the first time can be tricky. The problem is that everyone
has different Windows 95 sound settings and these affect TalkWorld. If
you have tried using a microphone in TalkWorld but cannot get it to broadcast
sound then please follow these steps through.</P></CENTER>
