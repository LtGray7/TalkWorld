<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>his section is intended to be a basic
guide to TalkWorld, it will teach you to move around and type messages
to the people around you. Once you feel confident with these basics or,
if you are familiar with other chat programs then you may want to move
on to <A HREF="advanced.htm">part 4</A>. </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>U</FONT>sing TalkWorld for the first time.<FONT SIZE=+2>
</FONT>Most of TalkWorld is controlled by the mouse. In this guide &quot;click
the mouse&quot; refers to a single click of the left button unless otherwise
stated. If you push the right button then usually a standard window will
pop up with the most useful commands depending on where the pointer is
positioned at that time. </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>hen TalkWorld has loaded you will see a main window
showing your view of the world (see below.) The icons above this are shortcuts
for the most common menu commands and there are miscellaneous windows down
the right hand side. To see what the icons actually do simply place the
mouse pointer over them for a few seconds and their name will pop up. </P></CENTER>

The TalkWorld Window.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he pictures on the right of the main view
display important information. The computer icon will animate when you
are receiving updates from the TalkWorld server. If it stops then you may
have a bad connection. Next to this is the ear icon. This will flash if
someone is trying to speak out loud to you. Next is a compass. Finally,
the picture of the face is used to change your characters mood. If you
right click on the face you can choose whether your character is happy,
sad, etc. There is more on this on the next <A HREF="chracter.htm">page</A>.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>B</FONT>elow the main view window is the text
window. This is where you will type your messages to other users and other
users messages will also appear here. If you wish to say something simply
type it out on the keyboard exactly like you would with any word processor
and push return. The message will appear next to your name immediately
but may take a few seconds to arrive on other users machines (this is called
'lag',) the same is true if somebody else says anything to you. </P></CENTER>
