<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>hen you find another user move the mouse
pointer over them and their name will pop up. Now you're ready to talk
to them.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>here are three modes of talking to other
users by using text. If you want to talk to the people around you click
on the 'talk to area' icon, this will send anything you type to the people
in your immediate area. Another way of talking to other users is the 'shout
to world' icon. This will broadcast whatever you type to everyone on TalkWorld!
This can be useful if things are quiet when you logon but if TalkWorld
is busy you may find that people become annoyed if you shout a lot. The
final choice for talking using text is to whisper. Whispering is how you
talk privately to another user. If you click on the 'whisper to' icon then
click on the character you want to whisper to then only that person will
receive anything you type until you cancel the whisper mode by clicking
on either the 'talk to area' or 'shout to world' icons.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>As well as communicating by text you can use a microphone to
speak to other users, this is explained <A HREF="../../../sounds.htm">later</A>.</P></CENTER>
