<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>H</FONT>ere are the guides to use TalkWorlds message
functions.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>alkWorld e-mail. This facility allows
registered users to send each other e-mails exactly as you would send an
e-mail to anyone on the Internet. The TalkWorld server stores the e-mails
until the user next logs on and checks for messages, so it can be a useful
way of communicating if timing makes it difficult to meet. </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>To send an e-mail click on the white envelope icon. There are
various options down the right hand side but their use should be straight
forward. The majority of the commands are the same as the ones used by
the message boards. Just write the e-mail exactly as you would write any
other. When you log on the server automatically checks if there are any
messages waiting for you.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he forums. As well as chatting and sending
e-mails to other users on-line you have a third option; the Message Boards.
The message boards allow users to type or speak a message similar to an
e-mail but instead of going to an individual the message is pasted on the
board where everyone who wants to can read or listen to it. </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>here is a message board in each of the
major areas of TalkWorld and they are based on appropriate subjects for
that area, e.g. religion for the Church. To access the message boards click
on the red book icon above the main window. The subjects for the area you
are in will load up in the window on the left, if you are not actually
in an area with a message board you will be informed of this. The message
boards tend to be in the large, named buildings on the map so head for
one of those. </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT> closed book icon on the message board
shows that there are messages in that subject that you have not read or
listened to. Click on the book to open it. When you have read a message
the book icon will remain open until you quit TalkWorld. An question mark
icon represents a speech message that someone has left, and it will change
to an exclamation mark when you have listened to it. Instead of writing
an original message users can also reply to a message that was written
previously, Replies will appear under the original message as will replies
to the reply, etc.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>o post a message click on the subject
you want to place it under and click the appropriate button, you will be
given the choice of leaving a text or vocal message. Alternatively by clicking
on a message that somebody else has left you can post a reply to that message.
Your message will then be posted on the board along with your name. Your
message will remain on the board for around two months.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Note that although the message boards are divided up into different
themes and subjects these are just guides, anyone can put messages about
anything they like on the boards. </P></CENTER>
