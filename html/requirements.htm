<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT>t the time of writing TalkWorld is only
available for Microsoft Windows 95. TalkWorld is not compatible with DOS
or Windows 3.x or earlier. </P></CENTER>

<UL>
<LI>Your computer must have at least 8mb (megabytes) of RAM and needs to
have around 10mb of hard disk space for TalkWorld to install into. </LI>

<LI>A TCP - IP Internet connection with an Internet Service Provider and
a 32 bit Winsock. Most companies support this but some companies like Compuserve
or Aol may not. Check with your service provider to find out if yours does.
</LI>

<LI>You need to have loaded the Microsoft Direct X drivers version 2.0
or higher. If you have loaded any recent Windows 95 computer games onto
your machine then you may already have them, if not the drivers are available
from our web site's download page <A HREF="http://www.etchinghill.com/ldownload.htm">here</A>
or direct from Microsoft's <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">site</A>.
</LI>

<LI>An unzip program (such as Winzip) to extract the TalkWorld archive
before installation. This is also available from our download page. </LI>

<LI>A modem capable of at least 9600 bps.<BR>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT>bove are the minimum requirements to run
TalkWorld. Providing you meet these specifications the program will run
but you may find the speed is a little lacking. Below is what we recommend
to get the best performance from TalkWorld. </P></CENTER>

<UL>
<LI>A Pentium processor (TalkWorld makes extensive use of the Pentiums
FPU.). </LI>

<LI>16mb of RAM and around 50mb of free hard disk space for TalkWorld to
use as it needs to. </LI>

<LI>A full duplex sound card and a microphone, without these TalkWorld
still works but you will be missing out on the speech. TalkWorld also works
with half duplex sound cards. (See the <A HREF="sounds.htm">sound</A> page
for more information.)</LI>

<LI>A 28.8 bps or higher modem. The faster the better. </LI>
