<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he majority of your time in TalkWorld
you will be using the left mouse button to select options or, if the mouse
is in the main window, to move yourself around. However, the right mouse
button is also used in TalkWorld, usually to bring up small context sensitive
menus. Depending on where the mouse pointer is positioned when you click
the right button, the window that appears will have a variety of different
choices on it. These are explained below.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><BR>
Emote - Clicking on this will persent you with a list of activities that
your character can perform in TalkWorld. Some can be used on other people
and some on yourself. Experiment with them to see which are which.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Teleport to - This will either teleport you to a person if you
used the right mouse button on the 'who?' screen or a place if you used
it on the 'teleport' window. </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Mail to - Clicking this will allow you to send a text or speech
message to the person that you had the mouse cursor over when you pushed
the right button. </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Whisper to - This will put you into 'whisper to' mode with the
user that you clicked on which means that anything you say will only go
to that person wherever they go in TalkWorld. To cancel this mode click
on either the 'talk' or 'shout' buttons.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Add to whisper list - This is similar to the 'whisper to' option
above but instead of your messages only going to one person, you can specify
up to four people who will all receive your messages until you cancel this
mode.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Veiw description - This will allow to view the description of
whichever user you selected.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Ignore - By selecting a user and then clicking this you are
informing the server that you no longer want to hear any messages that
user sends until you cancel he ignore command by selecting this option
again.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Ping - Ping is a technical command that allows you to measure
how quickly the user you selected is receiving updates form the TalkWorld
server. The longer the ping takes the worse that persons connection is.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Clear - Use this command on the text window to delete all of
the text that is there. New text will continue appearing as normal.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Save history - Use this command on the text window to save all
of the text that you have sent or received in your current TalkWorld session
to a text file. You will be asked to specify the name and location of the
text file.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Font type - TalkWorld has a choice of three different fonts
for text to appear in. Use this command on the text window to specify the
font of your choice.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Font size - Used with the option above this allows you to specify
the size of the text that you see as well as its style.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Add - This option is used with the one below to add your own
teleport points to the ones that TalkWorld has built in. If you find something
interesting you can use this button to add a teleport point there in order
to make it easier to return to it. When you create a teleport point you
will need to specify a name for it. See later for details on teleporting.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Delete - Use this option with the one above to remove teleport
points that you have created. Note that you cannot remove TalkWorlds built
in teleport points.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Sound on/off - This option will simply turn all of TalkWorlds
sound effects on or off until clicked again.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Button record/Auto record - This can be found be clicking on
the two small icons on the right of the TalkWorld screen. The option is
for use with a microphone. It sets whether your microphone is activated
to send speech when you click on the mic icon (button record) or by the
microphones recording threshold (auto record.) See the sound options page
for more details on these choices.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Expression (normal/happy/sad) - This is a shortcut that allows
you to quickly choose your characters facial expression.<BR>
