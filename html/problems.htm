</FONT>(Frequently Asked Questions)</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+2>H</FONT>ere are the answers to the questions we
are commonly asked regarding TalkWorld.</P></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Q</FONT> &quot;when I am using TalkWorld I can hear other
users talking to me but I can't say anything back.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A </FONT>To be able to speak out loud in TalkWorld you must
be a registered user. Unregistered 'Guests' can hear other people speaking
but can only reply by typing messages. For more information on registering
click <A HREF="register.htm">here</A>. If you are registered but still
cannot speak check your microphone is plugged in and working properly using
another program, e.g. Text Assist or Windows Sound Recorder. Then try clicking,
and holding the mouse button down on the microphone icon. At the bottom
of the TalkWorld screen it should say &quot;Sending speech to area.&quot;
Now say something and then let go of the icon to hear it repeated. Also
see the <A HREF="sounds.htm">sound</A> page for more information.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Q</FONT> &quot;The speech in TalkWorld is mangled or messy.&quot;
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT> TalkWorld supports both full and half duplex sound
cards, however half duplex cards may have problems sending and receiving
speech simultaneously. Some cards claim to be full duplex but do not support
all the features of being so, this can cause TalkWorld some problems. Unfortunately
there is nothing we can do about this problem at the moment. Also see the
<A HREF="sounds.htm">sound</A> page for more information..</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Q</FONT> &quot;When I have TalkWorld running the rest
of the programs on my machines work extremely slowly or stop working altogether.&quot;<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT> TalkWorld is designed to multi-task with other programs
but only when it is minimised. If TalkWorld is still on screen it continues
to receive data from the server which can severely hamper the performance
of your other programs. When you minimise TalkWorld it stops receiving
server data and shouldn't effect your computers performance at all. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Q</FONT> &quot;TalkWorld keeps crashing suddenly whilst
I am using it.&quot;<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT> TalkWorld will crash if your computer is running
low on virtual memory. This will happen if you had a lot of applications
running before starting TalkWorld and you are low on hard disk space. If
this is a problem try restarting your machine to clear out it's memory
before attempting to run TalkWorld, or make sure you have 10mb free space
left on your hard drive. You can find out if you do have enough space by
double clicking on 'My computer' then single click on your 'C:\ drive'
icon and the amount of free space will be displayed at the bottom of the
window.</P>
