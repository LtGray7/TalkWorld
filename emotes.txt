;The emote file - format is as follows...
;
;  CONTEXT:ACTION
;
; CONTEXT = what is displayed in the context menu. (20 char MAX)
; : = separating symbol
; ACTION  = what everyone sees when you 'do' that action (80 char MAX)
; 
;  The '%s' symbol is used to represent the person the action is performed upon
; such as 'Hug:hugs %s.' will produce 'Andy hugs April.' if Andy has selected
; April as the person to perform the action on.
